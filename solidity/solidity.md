# Solidity

## Structure of a Contract

Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages.

Each contract can contain declarations of **State Variables,Function,Function Modifiers,Events,Errors,Struct Types and Enum Types.**

Contracts can inherit from other contracts.

There are also special kinds of contracts called **libraries** and **interfaces**.
